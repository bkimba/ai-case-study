# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

OpenAI

Incorporated in 2015

Founding members include: Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, Wojciech Zaremba, Elon Musk and Sam Altman.

OpenAI’s inception started in 2015. Their goal was to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” In an interview with Joe Rogan, Elon Musk had worries about AI and the potential dangers it could pose to humanity. I believe this played a large role in the foundation of OpenAI with Elon wanting to get in front of AI before it grew into something potentially harmful. 

OpenAI received a pledge of $1 billion to start their non-profit organization. Recently, OpenAI received $10 billion from Microsoft for 2023. They receive their funding mostly from tech companies and investors. According to Alexei Alexis, a reporter for CFO Dive, OpenAI has raised a total of $11.3 billion. They are currently the number one AI provider in this regard.

## Business Activities

Greg Brockman of OpenAI is quoted to have said that they ignored the ‘have a problem to solve’ rule, which from my understanding is accurate. They were founded on the principle of ‘advancing digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole’. 

OpenAI’s intended customer base is the whole of humanity. Hoping to benefit us all with their work and this shows with the creation of ChatGPT and the accessibility that comes with it. According to OpenAI’s blog, They are a non profit company whose main goal is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. They share their patents with the entirety of the world and are committed to freely collaborate with other institutions working in a similar capacity to research and deploy new technologies.

The competitive solution that OpenAI offers is their incredible funding along with their creation of ChatGPT being such a wide known success and the first mainstream tool of its kind. 

OpenAI utilizes Microsoft Azure, ChatGPT, LangCHain, LlamaIndex, Dust.tt, Pezzo, LangKit and GPT Crawler as their main integration technologies. OpenAI itself is it’s own technology as well in the Large Language Models category. 

## Landscape
OpenAI is at the forefront of AI research and development with the largest known source of funding compared to its competitors. Google has released quite a few different technologies and is a force to be reckoned with within the sector of AI research and development. 

Within the last year of 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT-3 GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 which was a game changer for large language models. Other similar technologies that are available include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations Transformers), Bard which was developed by Google, PaLM2 (also developed by Google) which rivals GPT-4 and LaMDA (Developed by Deepmind).

Competitors in the same field of AI research and development include AI21 Labs, Aleph Alpha, 01.AI, Anthropic, Imbue, Fifth Dimension AI, Stability AI, Quantic Brains Technologies, Pryon and Irreverent Labs.

## Results

OpenAI revolutionized large language models with ChatGPT as a sensational and mainstream showcase of what AI can offer humanity. They have in a way, started the AI race and are a leading force within AI research and development. 

What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Popular classification metrics in AI research include, precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score. OpenAI’s ChatGPT’s precision in understanding what the user is asking is freakishly accurate, especially when the user has worded their inquiry in a more productive way that GPT understands. OpenAI performs well in this metric. Recall is a downfall of GPT. It is very confident in the answer it gives but sometimes can be wrong altogether. Accuracy, GPT is performing well in accuracy and only suffers from shortfalls in this category when user input isn't sufficient. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. GPT scores well in this regard with the overall satisfaction of users scoring high.

OpenAI is leading the charge in AI research and development with many strong competitors closely in tow.

## Recommendations

OpenAI for the most part has already offered an amazing service through ChatGPT. I would like to see them offer more technical solution driven software for particular fields such as construction and medicine. Some examples would be AI solutions for medical diagnostics and treatment, AI technologies that can provide solutions to reduce waste in the construction sector of business and utilizing AI technologies to create less environmentally intrusive architectural plans for buildings (commercial and residential), roadways, and building materials. Instead of being so broad in their scope of work, hone in on individual problems they see in humanity and solve those.

This way of thinking would help accomplish their goal to benefit humanity as a whole which I find to be a very noble pursuit. Their broad form of development is amazing but also hinders them in their ability to truly enact change in the world. Right now, they are more so providing tools for others to do so.

This technology would utilize their large language model alongside data and structural analysis of building plans and diagnostics. 

With the use of these technologies, which I believe they have already created the groundwork for, could help better humanity as a whole and accomplish their stated goal to ‘advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.’
